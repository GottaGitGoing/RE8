1. I would expect this NOT to compile. The static means that it will belong
to the whole class. Not just an instance of a class. Moreover, Static does
not have *this, which means that you can't access the instance variables of the
class.


2. I would expect this to be possible, since it's an instance of each of the
objects that you create from the class, you can call the member the static 
variable b, since b belongs to the whole class. (so the nonstatic member 
functions can access the static and the instance)
